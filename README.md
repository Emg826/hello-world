GitHub tutorial repository


This is a tutorial of how to use GitHub version control software.

GitHub Basic Tutorial

+ Repository = a container for an entire project or group of stuff.	
	+ Include README.md to explain what the project is
	+ >> ‘+’ >> select “new repository” 

+ Branch = work on different versions of a repository at same time
	+ master branch = main branch
	+ use branches (copies of master) to make edits; commit when finished
	+ Above list of files… >>  Branch button

+ Commits = saved / integrated changes from branches
	+ MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT BRANCH SELECTED
	+ can commit changes within branch and not affect main until later

+ Pull Request = proposing your changes and requesting review and pull into master branch 
	+ additions in green; subtractions in red via ‘Comparing changes’
	+ use ‘Pull Request’ tabs and go from there

+ Merge = bring into master branch
	+ pops up after pull request submitted
	+ can delete a branch after merge w/out affecting master (though, probably should keep just incase)
